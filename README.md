### Why Puppeteer?

We rely on your installed Chrome profile (`userDataDir`) so Google and most websites treat the process like a normal browsing session, dramatically reducing bot detection warnings.

### Timeout behaviour

Each tool fails fast after 5â€¯s if navigation stalls. Adjust with the `MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable or by passing a numeric second argument.
